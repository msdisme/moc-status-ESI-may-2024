title: Data Center Annual Maintenance Scheduled May 22-28, 2024
severity: 0
---

Please be advised that due to the annual scheduled maintenance power
outage at the MGHPCC data center, MOC Alliance (MOC A) services will
be unavailable from 8 am on Wednesday, May 22nd, 2024, until 8 pm on
Tuesday, May 28th, 2024.

To ensure that the Mass Open Cloud team can prepare for the outage,
it is imperative that you shut down any bare metal systems by 8 am on
Wednesday, May 22nd. Failing to do so may result in the loss of
your data.

Please note that MOC Alliance services may be available earlier than
May 28th. We will notify you of updates by updating the MOC A
[status website][status].

Once services are back online, you will be responsible for restarting
any systems.

In the event that you need access to any MOC A-hosted data during this
outage, it is highly recommended that you obtain copies of your data
before Wednesday, May 22nd. During the outage, the data center will be
entirely without power, and access to MOC-hosted services will be
impossible.

If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to open
a [support ticket][ticket]. The ticketing system will be available
throughout the outage.

For Research CEPH Cluster Users:

Due to the scheduled maintenance power outage, all ceph research
clusters and other research systems must be shut down by 8 am on
Wednesday, May 22nd. Failure to do so may result in the loss of your
data. Your cooperation during this maintenance period is greatly
appreciated.
