title: Maintenance on ESI OpenStack Neutron - possible network outages 10AM -3PM May 7, 2024
severity: 0
---

On Tuesday next week (5/7), between 10am and 3pm (EDT- GMT-4), we will be doing some maintenance on ESI OpenStack Neutron. Neutron is responsible for the networking in ESI, including floating IPs. 

We do not anticipate any disruption in networking during this operation, however, there is always a risk and it may result in interruptions in ESI networking. 

In this case, we have a roll back plan ready so we can roll back to a working state with as minimal interruption as possible. Thank you for your understanding!

Please open a ticket at support.massopen.cloud if you have any questions or if the timing of this maintenance will cause difficulties.
